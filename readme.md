# Week 2 Swiss Poster Challenge - ReadMe
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is my second week's homework assignment for Dynamic Web Dev. 


<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment, we were asked to pick a swiss poster design and replicate it to stay within its grid pattern regardless of the window size.

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->

# Notes & Process
* I made all of the element sizes in this site relative to the window width to maximize its ability to stay within the general grid plan.
* Since the event detail text can get very small, I added a hover feature that enlarges event text when you hover over the event (the text doesn't enlarge TOO much, because larger sizes broke the grid and/or spilled outside of the window)
<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->
## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
* I'm struggling with borders- the original poster has a very thin line between event details, and I wanted to place borders only on the bottoms of the list boxes... but for whatever reason I can't seem to make that work!

<!-- Any questions you have -->
## Questions
* How can you place border lines just on one side of a border box? is that possible? Is there a way to just insert a simple line?
